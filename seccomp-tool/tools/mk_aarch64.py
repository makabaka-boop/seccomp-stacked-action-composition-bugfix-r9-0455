"""Derive the aarch64 twin of an x86_64 policy.

Only syscall numbers and the arch tag change; every condition tree, action,
default and ordering is preserved. The generated filter exercises the exact
same compiler code paths for real kernel install verification on non-x86
hosts. The x86-64-specific guarantees (exact arch, x32-bit rejection) remain
encoded in the genuine x86_64 output.
